# Budget and Expense Tracker

## Description
A modern budget and expense tracker that allows users to add, remove and edit transactions, monitor monthly spending, and set custom budgets for different expense categories. I built this project after using simple spreadsheets to track my personal finances, wanting a more elegant and visual representation. The app demonstrates what a dedicated web-based expense tracker could look like, with clear controls and an intuitive interface for managing personal finances. 

The app was designed for personal use, and so does not include user authentication or individual user accounts. All data is stored globally in the database, which is a noticeable limitation of the app in its current state. Adding user accounts, authentication and individual data storage would transform the app from a personal use demonstration to a production ready application. These changes are planned for future iterations.

## Tech Stack
This project was built using Vite with React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and Express.js, Prisma and PostgreSQL for the backend and database.

I chose this tech stack to gain hands on experience with TypeScript, Express.js and Prisma, whilst deepening my understanding of React and Tailwind CSS. I selected Vite as the build tool for this project, because of its fast development experience with instant hot module replacement and native support for both React and TypeScript. It also handles production bundling and optimization automatically.
